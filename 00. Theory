Java is platform independent and the application will run on any platform. 

JVM
JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is platform dependent and is different for different OS.
It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. 
It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.
The JVM uses byte code to run it on a platform and hence makes Java platform independent. 
JVM starts to read the first file among thousands of files. We need to tell the JVM which file is our first file.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. 
JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each OS is different from each other. 
However, Java is platform independent.
There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.
The JVM performs the following main tasks:

1. Loads code
2. Verifies code
3. Executes code
4.Provides runtime environment


JRE 
JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. 
The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. 
It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. 
It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.


JDK 
JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. 
It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.

JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:
1. Standard Edition Java Platform
2. Enterprise Edition Java Platform
3. Micro Edition Java Platform
The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), 
a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.


The first file contains the main function or a specific signature( which include method names, values etc).
            ** public static void main(String args[])
The above line is the signature for a file to be the first file from which the compiler will start executing the program.

        JDK(Java Development Kit) contains JRE(Java Runtime Environment) contains JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
        JDK is used by developers. JAVA is WORA(Write once run anywhere).
